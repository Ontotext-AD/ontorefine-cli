# OntoRefine CLI

## Version 1.1

### New

 - TBD

### Changes

 - Moved the project back Java 11. Initially it was on 11, but before the first release it was downgraded to 8 due to development of an internal project. Now we are
   able to proceed with the initial plan and continue the development process with the current LTS version that is used internally in the organization.
 - All third party and utility libraries are now updated to the latest version. This is done in order to prevent any security issues due to libraries
   vulnerabilities. This will be done on regular bases in the future.
 - The version of the `ontorefine-client` library was updated to the latest in order to use the new functionalities that are developed there and to remove some
   bugs from the version `1.1.0` that was previously used.
 - Updated the CI scripts to the latest versions of the GitHub actions. Also we moved from `adopt` to `temurin` Java, because of the
   [AdoptOpenJDK transition to the Eclipse Foundation](https://blog.adoptopenjdk.net/2021/03/transition-to-eclipse-an-update/).
